Files and Directories

File Extension
 -> Code in the Terraform language is stored in plain text files with the .tf file extension. 
 -> There is also a JSON-based variant of the language that is named with the .tf.json file extension.
Files containing Terraform code are often called configuration files.

A module is a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory.
